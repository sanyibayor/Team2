Create a text file named "my_notes.txt" inside "my_documents"Use the command line to move "my_notes.txt" to a subdirectory called "notes_archive" within "my_documents."
Delete the "notes_archive" directory and all its contents using userdel command.

Ticket 002 -- File Manipulation
Create a new directory called "abi4abi", then inside it, create a .txt file using your first name . Write a sentence to the file. Use commands like cd, ls, touch, and nano or vim to perform these actions.

Ticket 003 -- User Management
Create a new user account with the username "testuser" using the useradd command.
Set a password for the "testuser" account using the passwd command.
Verify that you can log in as "testuser."
Delete the "testuser" account

Ticket 004-- File Permissions
Practice hanging file permissions in Linux. Create a new file and set specific permissions for user, group, and others using the chmod command.

Ticket 005-- Directory Navigation
Practice navigating the Linux file system. Start in your home directory, then use commands like cd, ls, and pwd to move to different directories, list their contents, and display your current location.

Ticket 006-- Search for Files
Use the find command to search for specific files within a directory and its subdirectories. Experiment with different options to refine your search criteria.

Ticket 007-- File Compression
Explore file compression techniques in Linux using tools like tar and gzip. Create a compressed archive of a directory and extract its contents to a new location.

Ticket 008 - Rename Files in  Directory
Create a new directory named in your group-alias. Write a script that renames all files in a directory by adding a prefix or suffix to their names. Test it with a sample directory.
(HERE IS A SAMPLE SCRIPT )

#!/bin/bash

# Define the directory path
directory="/path/to/your/directory"

# Define the prefix or suffix
prefix="prefix_" # Change this to your desired prefix
suffix="_suffix" # Change this to your desired suffix

# Navigate to the directory
cd "$group-alias" || exit

# Rename all files in the directory
for file in *; do
    mv "$file" "${prefix}${file}${suffix}"
done

echo "Files renamed successfully."


(NB: Replace "/path/to/your/directory" with the actual path to your directory. 
Make sure to make the script executable using:
chmod +x script_name.sh  in your command line.Then, execute the script: ./script_name.sh .This script will add the specified prefix and/or suffix to the names of all files in the specified directory.)

Ticket 009-- Process Management
Use commands like ps, top, and kill to manage processes in Linux. Practice listing running processes, monitoring resource usage, and terminating processes as needed

Ticket 10-- Systemd Unit Management

Ticket 11-- Adding a User to Sudoers
Edit the sudoers file to grant a user sudo privileges on your Linux system. Use the visudo command to safely modify the sudoers configuration and add the user to the sudo group for administrative access.

Ticket 12-- Using Vi to Write Simple Text
Practice using the Vi text editor to write simple sentences or notes in a text file. Learn basic Vi commands for navigation, editing, and saving text files, such as i for insert mode, :wq for save and exit, and :q! for exit without saving.

Ticket 13-- Checking System Information

Ticket 17-- Displaying File Content
Use commands like cat, less, and head to display the contents of text files. Explore options for viewing file contents, such as scrolling through long files, displaying specific line ranges, or searching for text patterns.

Ticket 18-- Copying and Moving Files
Use commands like cp and mv to copy and move files and directories between locations on your Linux system. Practice copying files to create backups and moving files to organize your filesystem.

Ticket 19-- Managing Permissions
Use commands like chmod and chown to manage file and directory permissions and ownership on your Linux system. Practice changing file permissions to control access rights for users and groups and modifying file ownership to manage file security.

Ticket 20-- Shutting Down Instance and Exiting MobaXterm
To gracefully shut down the instance and end the MobaXterm session, execute the following command:
sudo shutdown -h now
This command will initiate an immediate shutdown of the instance, halting all processes and powering off the virtual machine in a safe manner. After executing this command, ensure to close the MobaXterm session to complete the process.
